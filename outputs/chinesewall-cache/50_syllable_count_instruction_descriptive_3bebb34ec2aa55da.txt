    # A "combo" is when adjacent words cause two vowels to be pronounced as a single syllable.
    # First, let's create a variable to keep track of the number of combos. Initialize `combo_count` to 0.

    # EDIT: To find combos, we need to look at adjacent words. First, split the `line` into a list of `words`. The `split()` string method will be useful here.

    # EDIT: Now, loop through the `words` list to compare each word with the one that follows it.
    # A `for` loop using an index `i` from 0 to the length of the `words` list minus 2 will let you access `words[i]` and `words[i+1]` safely.

        # EDIT: Inside the loop, for easier reading, assign the current word (at index `i`) to a variable `word1` and the next word (at index `i+1`) to `word2`.

        # EDIT: Let's define the vowels we are looking for. Create a string variable `vowels` and assign it "aeiouy".

        # EDIT: We need to check several conditions to see if a combo exists. Let's create boolean variables (flags) to store the results of these checks.
        # IMPORTANT: When checking characters at a specific position in a word (e.g., the second character), you must first check if the word is long enough to avoid an error.

        # EDIT: Create a boolean flag `word1_ends_in_vowel`. This should be true if `word1` is not empty and its last character is a vowel.

        # EDIT: Create a boolean flag `word1_ends_in_vowel_m`. This should be true if `word1` has at least two characters, its last character is 'm', and the character before it is a vowel.

        # EDIT: Create a boolean flag `word1_ends_in_vowel_h`. This should be true if `word1` has at least two characters, its last character is 'h', and the character before it is a vowel.

        # EDIT: Create a boolean flag `word2_starts_with_vowel`. This should be true if `word2` is not empty and its first character is a vowel.

        # EDIT: Create a boolean flag `word2_starts_with_h_vowel`. This should be true if `word2` has at least two characters, its first character is 'h', and its second character is a vowel.

        # EDIT: Now, use an `if` statement to check if any of the combo patterns match using the boolean flags you just created.
        # A combo occurs if any of the following five conditions is true:
        # 1. `word1_ends_in_vowel` and `word2_starts_with_vowel`
        # 2. `word1_ends_in_vowel` and `word2_starts_with_h_vowel`

        # 5. `word1_ends_in_vowel_h` and `word2_starts_with_vowel`
        # If a combo is found, increment `combo_count` by 1.

    # EDIT: The final syllable count is the total number of vowels minus the number of combos.
    # The instruction "syllable_count increases by the number of 'combo'" appears to be misleading based on the examples.
    # Change the line below to calculate `syllable_count` as the value from `vowel_count(line)` minus `combo_count`.
