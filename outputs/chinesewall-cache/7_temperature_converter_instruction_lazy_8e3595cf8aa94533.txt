def fahrenheit_to_celsius(temperature):
    return ((temperature - 32)*5)/9

# EDIT: Define a new function here called `celsius_to_fahrenheit`.
# EDIT: This function should accept one argument, which we can call `temperature`.
# EDIT: Inside the function, you need to perform the calculation to convert Celsius to Fahrenheit.
# EDIT: The formula is: multiply the `temperature` by 9, then divide the result by 5, and finally add 32.
# EDIT: Return the final calculated value.
