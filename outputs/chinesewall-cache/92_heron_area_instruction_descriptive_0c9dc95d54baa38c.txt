def heronArea(sideLength1, sideLength2, sideLength3):
    semiperimeter = (sideLength1 + sideLength2 + sideLength3)/2
    # EDIT: The calculation inside the square root is incorrect. The last part of the expression is `* semiperimeter - sideLength3`. Because multiplication is performed before subtraction, this is not the correct order of operations. To fix this, you need to group the subtraction `semiperimeter - sideLength3` together by enclosing it in parentheses.
    return math.sqrt(semiperimeter * (semiperimeter - sideLength1) * (semiperimeter - sideLength2) * semiperimeter - sideLength3)
