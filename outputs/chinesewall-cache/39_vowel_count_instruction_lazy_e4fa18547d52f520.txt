    # EDIT: Loop through each diphthong in the list you just created.
    # EDIT: Inside the loop, replace all occurrences of the current diphthong in your `processed_line` variable with a non-vowel character (like a single "x"). This ensures the letters in the diphthong are not counted as individual vowels.
    
    # EDIT: Modify the for loop below. Instead of iterating over `prepare_line(line)`, it should now iterate over your new `processed_line` variable, which has had the diphthongs removed.
