    # EDIT: To fix this, we will modify the logic to "consume" cycles from `p2` as they are matched.

    # EDIT: Create a mutable copy of `p2`. We will remove items from this copy as we find matches.

    # EDIT: Loop through each cycle `c1` in `p1`.

    # EDIT: For each `c1`, we need to find a corresponding match in our copy of `p2`. We can use a boolean flag, initialized to `False` at the start of this loop, to track if a match is found for the current `c1`.

    # EDIT: Inside the first loop, create a second loop to iterate through the cycles `c2` in the copy of `p2`.

    # EDIT: Inside the second loop, check if `c1` and `c2` are a match using the `cycle_equality` function.

    # EDIT: If a match is found, update your boolean flag to `True`, remove the matched cycle `c2` from the copy of `p2`, and `break` out of the inner loop (since we've found the one unique match for `c1`).

    # EDIT: After the inner loop, check your boolean flag. If it's still `False`, it means no match was found for `c1`, so the permutations are not equal. Return `False` from the function.

    # EDIT: If the outer loop completes, it means every cycle in `p1` found a unique match. Return `True`.

    # EDIT: Finally, remove the old implementation below that uses the `hits` variable.
