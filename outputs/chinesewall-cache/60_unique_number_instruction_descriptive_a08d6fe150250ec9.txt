    # This variable will be used to accumulate the XOR of all the numbers in the list.

    # EDIT: Next, create a `for` loop that iterates through each `number` in the `numbers` list.

    # EDIT: Inside the for loop, update the `result` variable by performing a bitwise XOR operation with the current `number`.
    # The bitwise XOR operator in Python is `^`.
    # For example: `result = result ^ number`.

    # EDIT: After the loop finishes, the `result` will hold the unique number because all the paired numbers will have cancelled each other out.
    # Change the return statement to return the `result` variable.
