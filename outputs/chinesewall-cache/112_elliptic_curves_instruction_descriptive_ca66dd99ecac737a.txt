    # It should be type-hinted to return a point (tuple).
    #
    # The method body should be implemented as follows:
    # 1. Handle the base cases: if `k` is 0 or `P` is the point at infinity `(None, None)`, return the point at infinity.
    #
    # 2. Precomputation Step:
    #    a. Create a list named `precomputed_points` to store the first `2**w` multiples of `P`.
    #    b. Initialize the list with the correct size, `2**w`.
    #    c. Set the first element (for 0 * P) to the point at infinity `(None, None)`.
    #    d. Set the second element (for 1 * P) to `P` itself.
    #    e. Loop from 2 up to (but not including) `2**w`. In each iteration, calculate the i-th multiple of P by adding `P` to the (i-1)-th multiple, which is already stored in the list.
    #
    # 3. Main Calculation Loop:
    #    a. Initialize a `result` variable to the point at infinity `(None, None)`.
    #    b. Convert the scalar `k` to its binary string representation, removing the '0b' prefix (e.g., using `bin(k)[2:]`).
    #    c. Initialize a position variable, `pos`, to 0. This will track our progress through the binary string.
    #    d. Start a `while` loop that continues as long as `pos` is less than the length of the binary string.
    #
    # 4. Inside the `while` loop:
    #    a. Determine the end of the current window. The window starts at `pos` and is at most `w` bits long. Use `min()` to ensure the window doesn't go past the end of the binary string.
    #    b. Get the length of the current window (the number of bits).
    #    c. Extract the binary substring for the window and convert it to an integer. This integer is the index for our `precomputed_points` list.
    #    d. "Shift" the current `result` to the left by the length of the window. This is done by repeatedly calling `point_double` on the `result` for each bit in the window. A `for` loop can be used for this.
    #    e. After shifting, add the precomputed point (looked up from `precomputed_points` using the window's integer value) to the `result`.
    #    f. Update `pos` by moving it to the end of the window we just processed.
    #
    # 5. After the loop finishes, return the final `result`.
